# Module 9 Challenge

## Overview
This repository contains the solution to the Module 9 Challenge, where I designed a database schema and performed data analysis using SQL. 
The challenge involved creating tables based on CSV files, importing data, and answering various analytical queries about employees from the 1980s and 1990s.

## Project Structure
- `tableSchema.sql`: Contains the SQL commands to create tables with appropriate primary and foreign key constraints.
- `queries.sql`: Contains SQL queries to perform data analysis as specified in the challenge.
- `ERD.png`: An image of the Entity Relationship Diagram representing the database schema.
